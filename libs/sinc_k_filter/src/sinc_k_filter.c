     * made by design for CIC (Cascaded Integrator-Comb) filters:
     * https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/1337.php
     *
     * CIC filters suffer from accumulator (adder) arithmetic register overflow because of the unity feedback at each integrator stage.
     * This overflow is of no consequence as long as the following two conditions are met:
        * each stage is implemented with twoâ€™s complement (non-saturating) arithmetic [1,3], and
        * the range of a stage's number system is greater than or equal to the maximum value expected at the stage's output.
        *
     * as far as I understand this: even tough a overflow might occur here, it is not a problem as long as the diff
     * between the current and previous value would still be the same. If the diff is (would be) greater than the integer max value the
     * filter would not work anymore.
